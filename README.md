## Bonus changes:
- Added 2 new debug buttons 
    -  'k' will kill all enimies in an area
    -  'n' will allow you to skip to the win screen and therefor move to the next area without having to kill any enemies
    - These were added to facilitate the testing of key features like the new area and new entities.
- The dark tint in areas 1 and 3 are intentional, they were meant to give the game a somewhat more "spooky" feel.


## Notes:
- to implement the health drain feature in area 2 the health variables were changed from int to double
